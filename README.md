## Note
If you would like to run any of my solutions:
- Make sure you are using [Python 3.10.1](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3101/) (or later),
- Place **YOUR** Challange input in the same directory as the python script (This is bceause some challange inputs are user specific, so make sure to use the correct input that is associated with your account)

# Advent Of Code
___
These are my solutions to the annual [Advent of Code Events](https://adventofcode.com), Created by the talented [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)
___
## Note
If you would like to run any of my solutions:
- First, build the binary for the specific year you would like to run (Make sure you have rust installed)
- Next, create a folder called `inputs` in the same directory as the built binary
- Place **YOUR** puzzle inputs in the `inputs` folder, and make sure to name the file based on the input's corresponding day (e.g `day1.txt`)
- Enjoy :D
